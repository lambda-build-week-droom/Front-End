# Proposal

-   What problem does your app solve?

It reduces the load on hiring managers as far as the number of applicants they receive and have to look through.
As well as potential employees from having to submit applications for jobs where they have no idea if they even
have a shot at getting an interview. By not allowing the two members to communicate without both parties swiping
yes it elevates the unknown allowing all participants to make more productive use of their time.

-   Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

-   What is the mission statement?
    Be all that you can be, in the army!

# How to install and Run?

Chatify requires you to create your own environmental files and variables to run.

-   Fork and clone this repository
-   Run the command `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
    -   REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=[http://localhost:9000] **this will need to be changed to your server URL on deployement**
-   run `npm start`

# Features

-   What features are required for your minimum viable product?

-   What features may you wish to put in a future release?

-   What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

# Frameworks

-   What 3rd party frameworks are you considering using?
    Material UI, Axios, React, Redux, Faker, UUID4

-   Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
    No, none of the 3rd party frameworks require that we contact them to use the framework or lib.

-   Are you required to pay to use the API?
    Nope, We will make our own fake data for the time being.

-   Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
    Nope. Web dev here.

# For Data Scientists

-   Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.

-   You can gather information about the data set you&#39;ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.

-   Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

-   A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

# Target Audience

-   Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Professionals looking for work and for new hires. Prob age ranges between 18 through mid 40's maybe 50's.

-   What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
    none

-   Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

-   Research thouroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

# Prototype Key Feature(s)

-   This is the &quot;bread and butter&quot; of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you&#39;ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
